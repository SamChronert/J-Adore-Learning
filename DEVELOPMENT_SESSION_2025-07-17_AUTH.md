- Maintained localStorage for guest mode

**Key Changes:**
- Shows AuthScreen when no user logged in

#### 2. **server/index.js** - Enhanced with Auth
- Added dotenv configuration
- Imported database and auth modules
- Database connection on startup
- CORS configuration with credentials
- Auth endpoints integration
- Progress tracking endpoints
- Session management endpoints
- Enhanced health check with auth status

**New Endpoints Added:**
- `POST /api/progress/update` - Save user progress (protected)
- `GET /api/progress` - Get user progress (protected)
- `POST /api/sessions/start` - Start study session
- `POST /api/sessions/:sessionId/end` - End study session

### Documentation Created

#### **AUTHENTICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md**

- Security notes
- Next steps guidance

## 🔧 Technical Stack Updates

### Frontend Additions:
- **React Context API** for state management
- **Protected routes** pattern
- **JWT token** storage and management

## 📊 Feature Implementation Status

| Feature | Status | Details |
|---------|--------|---------|
| User Registration | ✅ Complete | Username, password, optional email |
| User Login | ✅ Complete | JWT token generation |
| Guest Mode | ✅ Complete | localStorage fallback |
| Progress Saving | ✅ Complete | Database for users, localStorage for guests |
| Session Tracking | ✅ Complete | Start/end times, categories studied |
| Token Verification | ✅ Complete | On app load and API calls |
| Logout | ✅ Complete | Clears tokens and user data |
| Error Handling | ✅ Complete | User-friendly error messages |

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Authentication Screens:
- Wine-themed gradient background
- Smooth transitions between login/register
- Clear error messaging
- Loading states for all actions
- Mobile-responsive design

### User Experience:
- Seamless guest-to-user upgrade path
- Persistent login (7-day tokens)
- Visual feedback for all actions
- Clear user status indicator

## 🔐 Security Implementation

- **Password hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **JWT tokens**: 7-day expiry for users, 24-hour for guests
- **Protected endpoints**: Authentication middleware
- **CORS configuration**: Credentials enabled
- **Input validation**: Frontend and backend

## 📈 Data Flow Architecture

```
User Action → AuthForm → UserContext → API Call → Server Auth → Database
                ↓                          ↓
            Local State              JWT Response
                ↓                          ↓
            UI Update               Token Storage
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Manual Testing:
- ✅ User registration flow
- ✅ Login with valid/invalid credentials
- ✅ Guest mode functionality
- ✅ Progress persistence
- ✅ Session tracking
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Token verification on reload

### Edge Cases Tested:
- ✅ Duplicate username handling
- ✅ Short password rejection
- ✅ Database connection failure (falls back to guest)
- ✅ Invalid token handling

## 📝 Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Password Reset**: Not implemented (planned for future)
2. **Email Verification**: Not required (by design)
3. **OAuth Integration**: Not implemented (future enhancement)
4. **Rate Limiting**: Basic implementation only
