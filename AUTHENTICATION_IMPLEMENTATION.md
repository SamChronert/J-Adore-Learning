# SipSchool Authentication Implementation Guide

## 🎉 What's New

### Authentication UI Components Added:
1. **AuthForm.jsx** - Login/Register form component
2. **AuthScreen.jsx** - Full authentication screen with mode toggle
3. **UserContext.jsx** - Global user state management
4. **UserHeader.jsx** - User info display and logout button

### Server Updates:
- **Authentication endpoints** integrated
- **Progress tracking endpoints** added
- **Session management** for authenticated users
- **Database integration** in server startup

### App.jsx Updates:
- **User authentication flow** integrated
- **Protected progress saving** for registered users
- **Guest mode** continues to work with localStorage
- **Real-time database sync** for authenticated users

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Any Missing Dependencies
```bash
cd "/Users/samuelchronert/Documents/Coding Projects/Sip_School"
npm install
cd client && npm install && cd ..
```

### 2. Restart the Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the New Features

#### Authentication Flow:
1. **Visit** http://localhost:5173
2. **You'll see** the login screen
3. **Create an account** using the "Create Account" link
4. **Or continue as Guest** to test without saving

#### Test Account Creation:
- Username: `testuser`
- Password: `test123` (min 6 characters)
- Email: optional

#### Features to Test:
- ✅ User registration
- ✅ User login
- ✅ Guest mode (no database saving)
- ✅ Progress persistence for authenticated users
- ✅ Logout functionality
- ✅ Session tracking

## 📊 Database Status

The SQLite database will automatically initialize when the server starts. You'll see:
```
📊 Database connected successfully
✅ Initialized 5 database tables
```

If the database fails to connect, the app will still work in guest mode.

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **JWT Secret**: Currently using default from .env - change for production
2. **Password Requirements**: Minimum 6 characters
3. **Token Expiry**: 7 days for registered users, 24 hours for guests
4. **CORS**: Configured for localhost development

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Authentication Tests:
- [ ] Register a new user
- [ ] Login with created credentials
- [ ] Try invalid login (wrong password)
- [ ] Test "Continue as Guest"
- [ ] Verify logout works

### Progress Tracking Tests:
- [ ] Answer questions as authenticated user
- [ ] Check progress persists after logout/login
- [ ] Verify guest progress uses localStorage
- [ ] Test category filtering with saved progress

### UI/UX Tests:
- [ ] Authentication screens are mobile-responsive
- [ ] User header shows correct username
- [ ] Error messages display properly
- [ ] Loading states work correctly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "npm: command not found"
- Already fixed! Node.js is now installed

### Database Connection Error
- Check if `data/` directory has write permissions
- Database will auto-create on first run
- App continues in guest mode if database fails

### Authentication Not Working
- Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
- Check server console for error messages
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set in .env

### CORS Issues
- Server is configured for localhost:5173 and localhost:3001
- Add your domain to ALLOWED_ORIGINS in .env if needed

## 📝 Next Steps

With authentication now working, you can:

1. **Test user registration and login flows**
2. **Verify progress saves to database**
3. **Plan the placement test feature**
4. **Consider adding password reset**
5. **Implement spaced repetition algorithm**

## 🎯 Quick Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start both server and client

# Database Check
sqlite3 data/sipschool.db    # Open database CLI
.tables                       # List all tables
.schema users                 # Show user table structure

# Clear Test Data
rm -rf data/sipschool.db     # Delete database (will recreate)
```

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### What Changed:
1. **App.jsx** now wrapped with UserProvider for auth state
2. **Server** includes auth routes and database initialization
3. **Progress** saves to database for authenticated users
4. **Guest mode** still works with localStorage only
5. **UI** shows login screen first, then main app

### Architecture:
```
UserProvider (Context)
  └── App
      ├── AuthScreen (if not logged in)
      │   └── AuthForm
      └── Main App (if logged in)
          └── UserHeader
```

---

**The authentication system is now fully integrated!** Test it out and let me know if you encounter any issues. The next phase can focus on the placement test and spaced repetition features.
