=== RECOVERY POINT - January 21, 2025 ===

## Assumptions Made During Recovery
1. Version 2.0.0 represents the "Overhaul" mentioned in commits
2. Generic commit messages suggest rapid iterative development
3. The placement test feature was added during the v2 overhaul
4. Answer variations database was developed alongside text input
5. Spaced repetition was implemented as part of enhanced learning features

## Key Development Milestones Identified
1. **Foundation Phase**: Basic flashcard app with authentication
2. **Enhancement Phase**: Text input, intelligent matching, hints
3. **Science Phase**: Spaced repetition, placement test, analytics
4. **Polish Phase**: UI improvements, bug fixes, documentation

## Technical Decisions Made
- Chose Vite over Create React App for better performance
- SQLite for simplicity and portability
- JWT for stateless authentication
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development
- Monorepo structure with separate client/server

## Current Working State
- All core features operational
- Authentication working properly
- Database properly initialized
- Frontend and backend communicating correctly
- Ready for production deployment

## Next Logical Steps
1. Integrate Claude API for dynamic questions
2. Add comprehensive test suite
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline
4. Enhance error handling and logging
5. Add user feedback mechanisms

=== DEVELOPMENT UPDATE - January 21, 2025 ===

## Version 2.2.0 Development Progress

### Completed Features

#### Authentication & Profile System
- **Auto-login after registration**: Users are now automatically logged in after successful registration
- **ProfileIndicator component**: Created dropdown menu in top-right corner showing username when logged in
- **Profile page**: Implemented dedicated profile page accessible via /profile route
- **API key management**: Users can now add their own Claude API keys through the profile page
- **Encrypted storage**: User API keys are encrypted before storage in the database

#### Answer System Redesign
- **Single attempt enforcement**: Modified QuestionCard to allow only one attempt per question
- **HintButton component**: Created dedicated hint button that must be clicked to reveal hints
- **Removed automatic hints**: Hints no longer appear automatically after incorrect answers
- **Clear indicators**: Enhanced visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

#### Infrastructure Updates
- **Increased rate limits**: Updated from 10 to 50+ requests per 15 minutes
- **ApiKeyNotification component**: Created persistent notification banner for missing API keys
- **User-specific rate limiting**: Implemented per-user rate limiting for API requests

#### Knowledge Tracking System
- **Comprehensive database schema**: Created new tables for advanced knowledge tracking
- **KnowledgeTrackingService**: Implemented service with mastery algorithms and learning metrics
- **Concept database**: Populated with 75+ wine concepts with relationships and prerequisites
- **Mastery tracking**: Implemented algorithms for tracking concept mastery and learning velocity

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Database Schema Additions**:
   - `user_api_keys` table for encrypted API key storage
   - `concepts` table with 75+ wine learning concepts
   - `user_knowledge` table for tracking individual concept mastery
   - `concept_relationships` table for prerequisite mapping
   - `learning_sessions` table for detailed session analytics

2. **New Components Created**:
   - `/client/src/components/ProfileIndicator.jsx`
   - `/client/src/components/Profile.jsx`
   - `/client/src/components/HintButton.jsx`
   - `/client/src/components/ApiKeyNotification.jsx`

3. **New Services Implemented**:
   - `/server/services/knowledgeTrackingService.js`
   - Enhanced user service for API key management

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for user API keys
   - Per-user rate limiting
   - Secure API key validation

### Development Challenges Resolved
- Successfully migrated from automatic hints to button-based system
- Resolved single attempt enforcement while maintaining progress tracking
- Implemented secure encryption for sensitive user data
- Created comprehensive knowledge graph for wine concepts
