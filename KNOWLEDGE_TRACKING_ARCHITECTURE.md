# Knowledge Tracking System Architecture

## Overview
The Knowledge Tracking System is a comprehensive learning analytics platform that monitors, analyzes, and adapts to each user's learning journey. It forms the core of SipSchool's AI-driven personalized education approach.

## System Components

### 1. Database Schema

#### Core Tables

**user_knowledge**
- Tracks mastery level for each concept per user
- Records success/failure rates
- Calculates learning velocity
- Maintains temporal data for progression analysis

**concepts**
- Hierarchical structure of wine knowledge
- Categories: Grape Varieties, Regions, Viticulture, etc.
- Difficulty levels for progressive learning
- Parent-child relationships for concept dependencies

**concept_relationships**
- Maps connections between related concepts
- Relationship types: prerequisite, related, similar, contrasts
- Strength values to weight importance

**learning_sessions**
- Captures session-level analytics
- Identifies knowledge gaps per session
- Tracks concepts reviewed and performance

### 2. Core Services

#### KnowledgeTrackingService
Primary service for all knowledge-related operations:

```javascript
class KnowledgeTrackingService {
  // Mastery Calculation
  calculateMastery(correctAttempts, totalAttempts, timeDecay) {
    const baseScore = correctAttempts / totalAttempts;
    const decayFactor = this.calculateDecay(timeDecay);
    return baseScore * decayFactor;
  }

  // Learning Velocity
  calculateVelocity(masteryHistory, timespan) {
    // Rate of mastery improvement over time
    return (currentMastery - initialMastery) / timespan;
  }

  // Knowledge Gap Analysis
  identifyGaps(userId) {
    // Find concepts with low mastery
    // Identify prerequisite gaps
    // Return prioritized learning path
  }
}
```

#### ConceptMappingService
Manages relationships between wine concepts:

```javascript
class ConceptMappingService {
  // Build concept graph
  buildConceptGraph() {
    // Create nodes for each concept
    // Establish edges based on relationships
    // Calculate optimal learning paths
  }

  // Find related concepts
  getRelatedConcepts(conceptId, depth = 1) {
    // Traverse graph to find related nodes
    // Return weighted by relationship strength
  }
}
```

### 3. AI Integration Layer

#### Adaptive Question Generation
```javascript
class AdaptiveQuestionGenerator {
  async generateQuestion(userId) {
    // 1. Query user's knowledge state
    const knowledgeProfile = await this.getKnowledgeProfile(userId);
    
    // 2. Identify target concepts
    const targetConcepts = await this.selectTargetConcepts(knowledgeProfile);
    
    // 3. Generate question via Claude API
    const question = await this.claudeService.generateQuestion({
      concepts: targetConcepts,
      difficulty: knowledgeProfile.optimalDifficulty,
      avoidMastered: knowledgeProfile.masteredConcepts
    });
    
    return question;
  }
}
```

### 4. Analytics Engine

#### Learning Analytics Dashboard
Provides insights into:
- Mastery progression over time
- Learning velocity by category
- Knowledge gap heat maps
- Predicted time to mastery
- Optimal study session timing

#### Performance Metrics
- **Concept Mastery Score**: 0-100 scale based on accuracy and recency
- **Learning Velocity**: Rate of improvement per study hour
- **Knowledge Retention**: Decay-adjusted mastery scores
- **Gap Priority Score**: Weighted importance of knowledge gaps

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Knowledge Tracking APIs
```
GET /api/knowledge/profile/:userId
- Returns complete knowledge profile

POST /api/knowledge/update
- Updates mastery after answer submission

GET /api/knowledge/gaps/:userId
- Returns prioritized knowledge gaps

GET /api/knowledge/analytics/:userId
- Returns learning analytics dashboard data

POST /api/knowledge/generate-question
- Generates adaptive question based on profile
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Implement database schema
- Create basic CRUD operations
- Build concept mapping for existing questions

### Phase 2: Tracking (Weeks 3-4)
- Implement mastery calculation algorithms
- Add learning velocity tracking
- Create knowledge gap identification

### Phase 3: AI Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Connect to Claude API for adaptive generation
- Implement question targeting based on gaps
- Add real-time knowledge updates

### Phase 4: Analytics (Weeks 7-8)
- Build analytics dashboard

## Data Flow

1. **Answer Submission**
   - User submits answer
   - System evaluates correctness
   - Updates knowledge database
   - Recalculates mastery scores

2. **Question Generation**
   - System queries knowledge state
   - Identifies optimal learning targets
   - Generates personalized question
   - Tracks question performance

3. **Analytics Update**
   - Batch process learning metrics
   - Update velocity calculations
   - Refresh gap analysis
   - Generate insights

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Cache user knowledge profiles (5-minute TTL)
- Cache concept relationships (1-hour TTL)
