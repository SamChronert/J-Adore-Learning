## Quick Start Commands

### 1. Start Development Environment
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev

# This starts both frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 3001)
```

### 2. Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Test Account: username: `wine_lover`, password: `test123`

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
# Backend tests
npm test

# Frontend tests
cd client && npm test
```

## All Critical Issues Resolved âœ…
- Single attempt system implemented
- Button-triggered hints active
- Complete profile system deployed
- User API key management functional
- Rate limits increased to 50+

## Future Development Roadmap
1. [ ] Implement code splitting and lazy loading
2. [ ] Add interactive wine region maps
3. [ ] Create voice input/output features
4. [ ] Build achievement and gamification system
5. [ ] Develop social learning features
6. [ ] Create mobile applications
7. [ ] Add offline-first capabilities
8. [ ] Implement advanced analytics dashboard

## Commands for Testing New Features
```bash
# Test auto-login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"newuser","email":"new@test.com","password":"test123"}'

# Test profile endpoints (after creation)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Test knowledge tracking
curl http://localhost:3001/api/knowledge/profile/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Remember: Core Philosophy
All features must support AI-driven personalized learning:
- User API keys enable unlimited personalization
- Single attempts encourage thoughtful learning
- Knowledge tracking enables adaptive content
- Profile system creates ownership of learning journey
