   - Claude API integration for dynamic questions
   - Personalized question generation
   - Rate limiting and caching
   - ⚠️ **Issue**: Server-side API key only (users can't add their own)
   - ⚠️ **Issue**: Rate limit too low (10/15min)

4. **Testing Suite**
   - 80+ comprehensive tests
   - Backend: Jest unit and integration tests
   - Frontend: Vitest with React Testing Library
   - High coverage on critical paths

5. **User Feedback System**
   - 5-star rating system
   - Categorized feedback
   - Admin dashboard
   - Flagging system

### ❌ Not Implemented (Required for v2.2.0)

1. **Authentication & Profile**
   - Auto-login after registration
   - Profile indicator (top-right corner)
   - Profile page with settings
   - User-specific API key management
   - API key notifications

2. **Answer System Redesign**
   - Single attempt enforcement
   - Dedicated hint button
   - No hints after submission
   - Clear attempt indicators

3. **Advanced Knowledge Tracking**
   - Knowledge database schema
   - Concept mastery tracking
   - Learning velocity metrics
   - Knowledge gap analysis
   - Concept relationships

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Increased rate limits (50+)
   - User-specific rate limiting
   - Enhanced caching

## Testing the Current System

### 1. Run the Application
```bash
npm run dev
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Test Authentication
```bash
# Existing account:
Username: wine_lover
Password: test123

# Register new account:
# Note: Does NOT auto-login (known issue)
```

### 3. Test Answer System
- Try answering questions
- Notice: You get 4 attempts (should be 1)
- Notice: Hints appear automatically (should be button)
- Test answer variations:
  - "Cabernet Sauvignon" → "Cab Sauv"
  - "Burgundy" → "Bourgogne"

### 4. Test AI Features
```bash
# First, add Claude API key to .env:
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Test with:
node scripts/test-claude-api.js

# In app, toggle "AI-Generated Questions"
```

### 5. Run Test Suite
```bash
# Backend tests
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Frontend tests
cd client
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

2. Convert to single attempt system
3. Create hint button component
4. Remove automatic hint triggering

### Phase 2: Profile System (Week 3-4)
1. Create profile page and routes
2. Add profile indicator component
3. Implement API key management
4. Add persistent notifications

### Phase 3: Knowledge Tracking (Week 5-6)
1. Design and create database schema
2. Implement tracking services
3. Build analytics endpoints
4. Create visualization components

### Phase 4: Infrastructure (Week 7-8)
1. Increase rate limits
2. Implement user-specific limiting
3. Enhance caching strategies
4. Add monitoring

## Success Criteria

### For v2.2.0 Release
1. All authentication features implemented
2. Single attempt system working
3. Knowledge tracking operational
4. Rate limits appropriate for production
